# Homework Assignment

## Part 1: Group Activities Recap

- Ensure that all **in-class group activities** are **completed**.  
  

---

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective**: To explore and understand the fundamentals of EDA using Python in a hands-on mini-project.  

1. **Video to Watch**:  
   - Watch the first **45 minutes only** of the following video: [Exploratory Data Analysis Video](https://youtu.be/1MGG75oUK7o).  
   - Pay close attention to the explanation of the **concepts and code walkthroughs**.  

2. **Source Code**:  
   - Download the source code from the following repository:  
     [EDA Project Repository](https://github.com/codebasics/project-da-online-retail-pandas).  

3. **Task**:  
   - Use **Google Colab** to run the source code provided in the repository.  
   - Ensure that all the code executes without errors.  
   - Identify and document any challenges faced (e.g., errors, unclear code snippets).  

4. **Clarifications and Help**:  
   - If certain parts of the code are unclear or confusing, use tools like **Bing Copilot**, **Claude.ai**, or your favorite **Large Language Model (LLM)** to get explanations and insights.  

5. **Reflection**:  
   - Highlight any issues encountered during the code execution process.

### Part 3: 

Your task is to review [the following article](https://francescopochetti.com/byte-pair-encoding-building-the-gpt-tokenizer-with-karpathy/), which explains how the GPT tokenizer was built using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). As a group, try to understand as much as possible. The good news is that if you grasp even **50%**, that’s already a great achievement! If you only manage to understand the **big picture**, that’s perfectly fine too.  

- The article is based on this **video** by Andrej Karpathy: [Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE).  
- You can also explore the **source code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe)  
- Additionally, a **Colab notebook** is available: [Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y0KnCFZvGVf_odSfcNAws6kcDD7HsI0L?usp=sharing)

### (Optional) Part 4:

For those trying to study BPE, [here is an exercise](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe/blob/master/exercise.md) on how you can build your own minbpe step by step.
